# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher solution

This is my solution to the [REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

I welcome any feedback on my solution, specifically about react and how I'm using it. 'Thinking in React' is a change to what I am previously used to, but I am enjoying it.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users can:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

### What I learned

I learned a lot from this project. It was my first time fetching data from an API using fetch with react, learning how to use fetch will be very useful I think. I also learned a lot about using Jest for testing and my next steps after this project will be to continue learning about testing.

I played about with my project structure a bit, as I was not sure how to structure my components. I ended up with a structure that I am happy with, but I understand there are many ways to do it.

### Continued development

If I was to continue development on this project, I would do the following:

- [ ] Implement clear button for search box and region select
- [ ] Change select box style to match the spec. (I used the default browser style)
- [ ] Better error/not found display, as the current one is not very user friendly.
- [ ] Lazy loading of countries list, currently all country data is loaded at once, including images.
- [ ] Use routing to allow users to navigate and share a countries detail page.
